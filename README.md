<h1>Hi there 👋, I'm Alaneme Anita</h1>
<p>
  <i>Aspiring Back-End Web Developer | ALX Software Engineering Learner</i>
</p>

## 🧠 About Me
I'm currently a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on **back-end web development**.
I started this journey because I’ve always been curious about how things work behind the scenes — how data moves, how systems talk to each other, and how the logic that powers applications is built.
What inspires me is solving problems, thinking logically, and building things that make life easier for others.

## 🎯 My Goals

- To build a solid foundation in back-end development
- To gain real-world experience through hands-on learning
- To contribute to meaningful projects and grow my skills
- To eventually work on secure, scalable systems that power everyday tools
